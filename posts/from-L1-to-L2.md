This is the story of how I went from Software Engineer I to Software Engineer II at GitHub.
Keep in mind that all companies have different title names and different requirements to advance to the next level.

The goal of this document is to capture the actions I took from July 27, 2021 to Nov 1, 2021 to earn the promotion.

### 1. Defining and revising goals

I will start strong with this this one. I genuinely think having a clear plan for the next 30, 60 and 90 days is 
vital for growth, especially at the begining of your career. When you start your first job, everything moves 
fast and everything is new to you. Each day that passes you discover what is within your reach and what will 
take longer to achieve.

The idea of a 30, 60 and 90-day plan is to set short, medium and long-term goals for yourself during the first
stage of your career. These goals need to be achievable. There is no point in adding something to the list that 
will require a major re-design of a system or that needs approval from multiple people. This would eat into your
allotted time and it goes against giving yourself time to get comfortable and familiar with everything about your
role: team, department, company, codebase, services, systems, communities of belonging... remember it is a 
marathon, not a race.

This is what my 30-60-90 plan looked like when I joined GitHub.

```
30: Focusing on the now
- Solve first issue
- Ship first pull request
- Update onboarding docs with learnings and recommendations
- Meet teammates

60: What can I do next?
- Create a database migration
- Learn how to use the data warehouse
- Add a feature flag
- Participate in UX research

90: Looking ahead
- Participate in events from a Community of Belonging
- Write a background job
- Add a new event to the data warehouse
- Work on issue involving another team
```

As you may have noticed, there are items in my plan that required working on a feature that, for example, 
involved adding a new field to a table in the database. Because of that it is also key that you share with your
manager the plan you have designed. Include them in this process and make sure both of your objectives are
aligned. This will make a huge difference as they can place you in projects that will involve the task you
are looking for, they can connect you to people who have done these tasks before, and you can track with them
how you are doing with your plan during your 1:1s.

### 2. Knowing your tools

When you set up your physical office space you make sure you have a chair, desk, monitor, keyboard and mouse
that work for you. In a similar way, you should work towards having a development environment that will make
your job easier. These can range from apps to IDE extensions and config/preference files.

This is my list of tools:
```
Apps:
1Password
Edge
Gifski
Magnet
MeetingBar
Notion
Pandan
PastePal
Quicktime Player
Rocket
Slack
Spotify
Tuple
VSCode
Zoom

VSCode extensions:
Alternate file
ERB Linter
ESLint
GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Copilot
Gitlens
Ruby
ruby-rubocop
```

If you do not know where to start, ask your teammates what tools they use and recommend.

### 3. Taking a fresh look at existing systems

### 4. Learning existing patterns

### 5. Building a cheatsheet

### 6. Finding great code reviewers

### 7. Getting yourself unblocked

### 8. Making data-driven decisions

### 9. Coming up with your own solutions
