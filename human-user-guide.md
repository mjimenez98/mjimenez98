## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I am a social introvert. Love spending most of my time at home but I do pursue hanging out outside, traveling and going to live events.
* I am 1/2 Dominican, 1/2 Spanish but I live in Canada. My answer to "where are you from?" will depend on how I feel that day.
* I do not mind going to concerts, the movies and restaurants by myself if I do not find someone to go with.

### What drives you nuts?
* Superiority complex. Throughout my years playing football (soccer) I have realized how much I dislike those who somehow believe they own everything and dismiss others.
* Crime. I think it is the measurement of societal collapse, a reflection of inequality and lack of access to basic needs.
* Lack of structure, organization and critical thinking. To me, if these traits are not present in a community (organization, company, group, country...) then I do not want anything to do with it.

### What are your quirks?
* I love structure and organization. One of the things I am most proud of is organizing a road trip across Iceland with 8 other friends to do the [Ring Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland)). I put together an itinerary, showed my friends a PowerPoint presentation and 9 months later we were on a plane.
* I like to watch videos on urban planning and transportation design. Big lover of walkable cities!
* I religiously go to the movies every Tuesday. To this day I have watched over 850 movies. Always happy to provide a recommendation if asked for one ðŸ™‚.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* I do not hate the country I grew up in, but I am critical of it and do not plan to live there again.
* I will not randomly text you to see how things are going but that doesn't mean I don't value our relationship or that I don't care about you. Instead of texting I would rather have a call or do an activity together.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* Mentorship: Those who give you the tools to become a better teammate and developer via code reviews, feedback, suggestions and tips.
* Knowledge: There is so much to learn from seeing someone perform or listening to them explain their take on something.
* Down to earth: A combination of humility, whimsy and being genuine.

### What do you wish colleagues didnâ€™t do?
* Come to the table with a superiority complex
* Seek to assign blame on someone
* Not recognize when they have made a mistake

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Giving credit where credit is due
* Taking the time to help and teach others

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

I am a true believer in the phrase "teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime". This means my method is to 

1) define goals, 
2) develop short, medium and long term plans that will lead us to those objectives, and 
3) have regular check-ins to track progress and make adjustments if needed.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with you?

For conversations that consists of 1-3 questions: Slack. However, for longer conversations: video chat. When chatting it is common for me to edit my reply over and over again because I tend to overthink things. On the other hand, when having conversations over voice or video I usually am more loose. I also welcome voice or video because we often do not get enough opportunities to have 1:1 talks with each other.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to convince you to do something?

Tell me how this will impact people and make their lives better.

### How do you like to give feedback?

In written form. It gives me time to think and find the right words to convey what I want to say. Also, I like to include the 5Qs: _when_, _where_, _why_ and _what_ went wrong, and _how_ things could have been done differently.

### How do you like to get feedback?

Via video backed by a document. This way I can revisit the feedback provided and track my progress. I appreciate including in said document answers to the 5Qs.
